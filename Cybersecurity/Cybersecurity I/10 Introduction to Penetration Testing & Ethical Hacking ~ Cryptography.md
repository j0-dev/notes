# INTRODUCTION TO PENETRATION TESTING & ETHICAL HACKING / CRYPTOGRAPHY
02-12-24


---
## KEY POINTS

- Penetration testers will not only **discover** vulnerabilities but also aim to **exploit** those vulnerabilities (in contrast to a vulnerability assessment).

- To be successful, penetration testing requires a **well thought out process** - **the success of a given task will depend on the success of the preceding task**.

- The **information gathering phase** is what differentiates a **good** pentester from a **bad** one.

- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a gold-mine for penetration testers**.
