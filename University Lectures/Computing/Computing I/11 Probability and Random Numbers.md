# PROBABILITY AND RANDOM NUMBERS
10-12-24

## KEY POINTS

- The probability of **compound chance** is calculated by **multiplying chances together**: 
    - (For example, tossing a coin 3 times: $1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8$ or $0.125$)

- "Randomness" can be improved by using **external, naturally random influences**, such as mouse position.
