## Key Concepts

- The **abacus** can be considered a primitive computer, with advanced users being able to do multiplication, division, and even square and cube roots.
- Computers started out as **machinery**, utilising things such as looms or **punch cards.**
- The first digital computers were developed **post WWII** and driven by military need.
- This then evolved into the **personal computer** age.

## Detailed Notes

### Pioneers of Computing
##### Charles Babbage
Developed mechanical calculators during the 19th century, most notably the unfinished Difference Engine.
##### Ada Lovelace
Worked alongside the likes of Babbage, and especially interested in the Analytic Engine. Her work let to the first computer "program"; a set of instructions to compute the Bernoulli numbers.
##### Alan Turing
An English mathematician, regarded as the father of computer science. He formalised concepts such as algorithms and computation. He gave us the concept of the [[Turing Machine|Turing Machine]] and the [[Turing Test|Turing Test]].

### First Computers/Technologies
##### ENIAC
The **E**lectronic **N**umerical **I**ntegrator **A**nd **C**omputer was the first general-purpose, all digital computer. Driven by military need, designed to calculate artillery firing tables. It performed calculations approximately one thousand times faster than the best electro-mechanical machines of the time.
##### The Transistor 
Computers used to rely on vacuum tubes, but in 1959 a practical and compact transistor was created (the MOSFET). It is estimated that over 13 *sextillion* of them have been produced since their invention.
##### Integrated Circuits
The concept of an integrated circuit removed the need to build devices from individual components each time. The size, speed and capacity of chips has progressed exponentially, roughly following a pattern called [[Moore's Law]].
##### Microprocessors
The microprocessor takes the concept of an integrated circuit and (essentially) delivers a whole computer on a chip - what we would today call a [[CPU]].
##### Apple I (1976)
Early calculators had brought microchip technology to the amateur enthusiast, but it was perhaps the [[Apple I.jpg|Apple I]] which showed a full microcomputer could be sold to the public. It went on sale for $666.66 in July 1976. Their commercial success began with the [[Apple II.jpg|Apple II]] in 1977, alongside machines from other companies such as the [[Commodore PET.jpg|Commodore PET]] and [[TRS-80.jpg|TRS-80]].
##### The Sinclair Machines
The [[ZX80.jpg|ZX80]] was notable for being one of the first computers to be available in the UK for under Â£100.
