## Key Concepts

- A database is an **organised collection of data** that is structured in such a way as to facilitate efficiency of:
	- **Storage**
	- **Retrieval**
	- **Modification**
	- **Management** of information.

## Detailed Notes

### What is a Database?
##### Definition
- A database is a method of structuring data.
- It's structure can be written out formally, which is known as [[Normalisation]].
- The design of a database often involves work away from the computer.
- A database is **not** an application package - It is primarily designed to store, manage, and retrieve. 
##### Examples
- *Amazon* - Amazon store their details about stock to be sold, customer orders, etc.
- *NHS* - Has data stored on all their patients, doctors, nurses, staff.
- *University of Chester* - Student information, staff, modules, etc.

### Database Structure
##### Tables
Tables are entities which we want to store data about. For example: staff, students, patients. The table is essentially the **drawer of the filing cabinet**. Tables form a template for each record, i.e, states what data each record will contain.
##### Records
Records are individual entities, such as a single patient in the patient table. Think of a record as a **single file inside one of the drawers in the filing cabinet.**
##### Field Types
Fields can be of different types:
	- *int; smallint* - numbers typically used for fields such as 'age'
	- *float; real* - numbers with a decimal, such as temperature.
	- *char* - used for words or text (fixed length).
	- *varchar* - same as char but **not** fixed length.
	- *date; time* - for example date of birth.
	- *bit* - boolean (true or false).

## Practical
#### Questions

*"What advantages does a computer database have over a paper database?"*
	- A computer database is better for speed and efficiency. The data can be inputted easier, and stored more securely. Digital data can hold much more information in a smaller area, and it can also be duplicated to maintain availability.

*What advantages (if any) does a paper database have over a computer database?"*
	- A paper database is simpler, less prone to hacking, and won't suffer technical faults. Some users also prefer the tactile experience of paper documents over digital.
