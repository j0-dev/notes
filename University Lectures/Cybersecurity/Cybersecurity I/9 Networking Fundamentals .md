# NETWORKING FUNDAMENTALS

## KEY POINTS

- The *TCP/IP* (Internet Protocol Suite) is the *main standard* for communication between systems and devices.

- A node is a *network-connected system*.

- Data is known as a *packet*. Packets are streams of bits which carry information.

- *TCP* is a *reliable* transport layer protocol; it ensures *ordered and error-checked delivery* of data, and uses a three-way handshake. *UDP* is an alternative; if applications do not require reliable delivery of data, UDP provedes connectionless service and gives priority to latency.

- The *ARP Protocol* helps hosts on a switched network to *map IP addresses to MAC addresses*.
