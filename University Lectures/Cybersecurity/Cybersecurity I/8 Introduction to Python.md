## KEY POINTS

    - Python is an *interpreted, object-oriented, and high level* language. 

    - Idle is best used for when you want to *repeat tasks*; works similar to terminal in that you interact with the language directly.

    - Python is *dynamically* and *strongly* typed. Type checking is performed at run-time, and it doesn't allow implicit type conversions.
