# CAN THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF AI TOOLS EVENTUALLY UNDERMINE COMPUTING AS A PROFESSION?

## INTRODUCTION
-	AI is the science of designing and building computer-based solutions for performing human tasks (Simon, 1980 as cited in Prentice et al., 2020) 
-	The Alan Turing Institute defines generative AI as an “artificial intelligence system that generates text, images, audio, video or other media in response to prompts.” (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	At it’s core, generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed to produce new content based on patterns and data they’ve learned (Pazur, B., 2024).

## THE GROWTH OF AI APPLICATIONS
-	The UK AI market is predicted to grow to $1 trillion (USD) by 2035. Donelan, M. (2024)
-	Artificial intelligence can be considered the leading component of the industrial transformation enabling intelligent machines to execute tasks autonomously such as self-monitoring, interpretation, diagnosis and analysis. (Ahmed & Jeon, 2022.)
-	There hasn’t been a tech advancement that’s caused such a boom since the internet and, later, the iPhone (Pazur, B., 2024)
-	Generative AI developments and product launches have accelerated rapidly since 2022 (Pazur, B., 2024)
-	ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022 and crossed 1 million users in just 5 days of launch (Nerdynav, 2024).
-	AI is progressing rapidly across many important fronts (Tegmark, M., 2017)
-	More than 29 million Britons already have access to eConsult, which allows you to type in your medical symptoms into a text box and have them analysed by a (human) doctor across 3,200 general practices in the UK. It’s likely soon you’ll cut out the human and have that input analysed by AI. (Stokel-Walker, C., 2024)

## EVOLVING LANDSCAPE OF THE COMPUTING PROFESSION
-	“However, some emerging academic research indicates that developments in generative AI may be linked to a loss in the quality and earnings of white collar jobs”. (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	The use of algorithms in recruitment has increased in recent years, in all stages of the recruiting process. (UK Gov, 2020)
-	There are many ways bias can be introduced into the recruiting process when using data driven technology. Decisions such as how data is collected, which variables to collect, how the variables are weighted, and the data the algorithm is trained on all have an impact and will vary depending on the context. (UK Gov, 2020)
-	One company developed a predictive model trained on their company data that found having the name “Jared” was a key indicator of a successful applicant. This is an example where a machine learning process has picked up a very explicit bias (UK Gov, 2020)
-	In March 2023, we published our AI regulation whitepaper, setting out initial proposals to develop a pro-innovation regulatory framework for AI. Donelan, M. (2024)
-	The AI industry employs over 50,000 people and contributes £3.7 billion to the economy in the UK. Donelan, M. (2024)  
-	In general, AI is used to automate mundane, low-level tasks (Prentice et al, 2020.)
-	Much of the public attention paid to artificial intelligence concerns it’s impact on jobs (Agrawal et al., 2019)
-	(Ironically) Some tasks, like demand forecasting, are being increasingly replaced by artificial intelligence. (Agrawal et al., 2019)
-	“In 2022, a report commissioned for the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology stated that investment in the UK AI sector grew five-fold between 2019 and 2021, and that it brought in £10.6 billion in revenue and employed over 50,000 people (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	The use of artificial intelligence gives businesses the “potential to improve operational efficiency", as well as generate “new revenue streams, innovate products, and ultimately redefine businesses” (Cognizant, 2024). 
-	The future is likely to see an increase in the public-sector use of automated decision-making systems which employ machine learning techniques (Cobbe, 2018)
-	The main idea of industry 4.0 is to produce extraordinary operational performance and productivity and, at the same time, a powerful level of automation (Ahmed & Jeon, 2022.)
-	AI can allow robots to complete tasks that a human would not perform, for instance, managing critical or dangerous raw materials or microscopic elements. (Ahmed & Jeon, 2022.)
-	According to a McKinsey global AI survey, 65% of respondents said their organizations regularly use generative AI – nearly double the figure reported just 10 months earlier (Pazur, B., 2024)
-	If AI’s economic impact keeps growing, we also have to decide how to modernise our laws and what career advice to give kids so that they can avoid soon-to-be-automated jobs (Tegmark, M., 2017)
-	AI tools can act as a great leveller, skilling up those who struggle with workplace communication in a way that enables them to tackle situations they used to have difficulty navigating. Four in five people surveyed by workplace consultants Korn Ferry said ChatGPT is a “legitimate, beneficial work tool”. The use of generative AI is helping overcome barriers. But it’s also throwing up blocks and new challenges (Stokel-Walker, C., 2024)
-	Natural language processing is now one of the most rapidly advancing fields of AI, and I think that further success will have a large impact because language is so central to being human. The better an AI gets at linguistic prediction, the better it can compose reasonable email responses or continue a spoken conversation (Tegmark, M., 2017).
-	Career advice for todays kids: Go into professions that machines are bad at – Those involving people, unpredictability and creativity. 
-	Computation keeps getting half as expensive roughly every couple of years, and this trend has now persisted for over a century (Tegmark, M., 2017)

## ETHICAL/LEGAL IMPLICATIONS AND SECURITY ISSUES
-	“There is no dedicated AI legislation in the UK” (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	“The rapid advancement of AI capabilities means that policy implications are continuously shifting. Some stakeholders have called for further government action” ” (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	“The UK Governments 2023 policy paper on “a pro-innovation approach to AI regulation” defined AI, AI systems or AI technologies as “products and services that are adaptable and autonomous”.  (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	An issue with Artificial Intelligence models is their “black box nature" (Christian, 2020).
-	A quote from David Graeber in “The Alignment Problem” (Christian, 2020) highlights this point; “the rules are supposed to be clear, uniformly expressed, and accessible to all. As we know, this is rarely actually the case”. 
-	It can be unclear to a person adversely affected by an automated decision that AI was used, what choices were made by developers, what went wrong, who is liable, and how to seek redress”. (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	Generative AI tools that generate inaccurate text and realistic images, videos, and other forms of mis- and disinformation have become increasingly accessible. (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	Generative AI can be used to create fake personas online, or impersonate real people. This increases security risks, such as confidential information being unwittingly released to malicious actors, and convincing phishing and scam calls (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	Generative AI tools can output written, visual, oral, or audio-visual works that can mimic the style of specific human creators if their works are present in the datasets (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	While there is no current body of UK law specifically regulating AI, there are numerous laws that restrict how AI can be used in practice, including (HoC Library briefing on AI and employment law):
  - Data protection law
  - Equalities, privacy, and common law
  - Intellectual property law (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	Some legal academics have stated that mechanisms already exist in UK law (section 49 of the Data Protection Act 2018) to ensure human oversight in automated decision making. However, other academics and civil society groups have raised concerns that in many systems, even when a human is involved in compliance with the law, they defer their judgement to AI. (Bhatnagar & Gajjar, 2024)
-	Algorithms, like all technology, should work for people, and not against them (UK Gov, 2020)
-	Good use of data can enable organisations to shine a light on existing practices and identify what is driving bias (UK Gov, 2020)
-	The risk is growing as algorithms, and the datasets that feed them, become increasingly complex.  Organisations often find it challenging to build the skills and capacity to understand bias, or to determine the most appropriate means of addressing it in a data driven world. (UK Gov, 2020)
-	Regulators and industry bodies need to work together with wider society to agree best practice within their industry and establish appropriate regulator standards (UK Gov, 2020)
-	57% of people were aware of alogorithmic systems being used to support decisions about them, with only 19% of those disagreeing in principle with the suggestion of a “fair and accurate” algorithm helping make decisions about them (UK Gov, 2020)
-	Recommendation 1: The Equality and Human Rights Commission should update its guidance on the application of the Equality Act 2010 to recruitment, to reflect issues associated with the use of algorithms, in collaboration with consumer and industry bodies. (UK Gov, 2020)
-	Recommendation 2: The Information Commissioner’s Office should work with industry to understand why current guidance is not being consistently applied, and consider updates to guidance (e.g. In the Employment Practices Code), greater promotion of existing guidance, or other action as appropriate (UK Gov, 2020)
-	AI is only as good as the data you feed it (Pazur, B., 2024)

## AI'S IMPACT ON CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS AND THE FUTURE
-	As a natural progression of this evolution, AI and machine learning are used as one means of curation. AI-based curation refers to the use of algorithms to process huge volumes of data and decipher meanings and patterns. AI works by analysing user data to make sense of user intent, thereby helping marketers to address consumers better. (Roy, 2018)
-	McKinsey conducted a study with the Cannes Lions and the Association of National Advertisers on the topic of combining data with creativity. Based on research among more than 200 firms, it was found that enterprises that integrate data and creativity were growing two times faster than their peers, a “substantial” difference of 10% vs 5% according to Brain Gregg, senior partner (Roy, 2018)
-	The UK AI market is predicted to grow to $1 trillion (USD) by 2035. Donelan, M. (2024)
-	AI adoption will skyrocket over the next decade before settling into maturity … Adoption could leap from 13% to 31% in just four to eight years (Cognizant, 2024)
-	The job market could be disrupted. 52% of all jobs are predicted to significantly change as generative AI is integrated to automate job tasks. 
-	As these technologies continue to grow, they will influence the social context and quality of life in the future (Ahmed & Jeon, 2022.)
-	The trade off for free access was giving up your data to improve the tools. People became the product (Stokel-Walker, C., 2024)
-	The intent to open-source the research seems clearly good in the short and medium term, but raises some concerns in the long run when getting closer to general AI.
-	AI is already being used to help doctors decipher tricky diagnoses (Stokel-Walker, C., 2024)
-	Providing people with income isn’t enough to guarantee their wellbeing (Tegmark, M., 2017)
-	A 2912 meta-analysis showed that unemployment tends to have negative long-term effects on well-being (Tegmark, M., 2017)

## CONCLUSION
-	Despite it’s challenges, generative AI is undeniably transformative (Pazur, B., 2024)
