A senior manager in a UK Energy PLC with particular focus (accountability) and interest on technology,
compliance and property estate management. Specialisms in the UK Data Protection Act and Cyber
Security. Chartered member of the British Computer Society and a CISM certified Security Manager.
I have previously supported the UK Government IT Apprenticeship scheme as a member of the Quality
Assurance Board and I am now looking to support and represent Calday parents, students, and staff in
the academic development of the Grammar School.
Victoria and I live in West Kirby, our son has been at Calday since Year 7 (from St Bridgetâ€™s Primary
School), is currently in Year 11, with progression to A Levels and our daughter is a student at
Birkenhead School. Victoria has an established career in higher education as a University Marketing
Director (as far as the kids understand - she colours in, and I ask people to switch their computers off and on!). Though my interest areas may be considered 'dry', I am considered to be approachable and enjoy
discussion and debate. Calday school is a good institution and the next phase of its evolution should be to support it in becoming a great institution for academic progression.
