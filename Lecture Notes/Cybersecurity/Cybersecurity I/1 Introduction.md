## Key Concepts

-  As technology continues to evolve over time, so do the associated security challenges.
-  Cybersecurity: "==The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber attacks.=="

### Cybersecurity

##### The CIA Triad
The [CIA Triad](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-CIA) is a model which is used to develop security policies and promote aware of the various aspects of IT and cybersecurity. This encompasses:
- *Confidentiality* - The act of keeping user data secure from those looking to gain unsolicited access.
- *Integrity* - Ensuring the information provided to the user is accurate and up-to-date.
- *Availability* - Ensuring the user(s) can access their data as and when they need to without interruption.

##### Actors, Attackers and Targets:
==Actors in cybersecurity are individuals or groups that engage in malicious activities== in the digital realm.
Attackers are essentially the same as threat actors, but the term emphasises their active role in carrying out malicious activities. They ==exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems==.
Targets are the individuals, organisations or systems that threat actors aim to compromise or exploit.

##### Threats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks:
- A *vulnerability* (loophole or weakness) in a system exposes it to a threat of being exploited by attackers.
- A *zero-day* vulnerability is a type of software vulnerability which is unknown or unaddressed by those who should be actively interested in mitigating the vulnerability.
- An *exploit* is special code which is specifically designed to take advantage of a vulnerability.

##### Social Engineering:
- The art of manipulating people in such a way to give up confidential information.
- Can include; bank information, passwords, other sensitive data.
- It can also result in an individual unwittingly giving an attacker control over their own computer system.

##### Malware:
- Malware is a form of *malicious software* which often masquerades itself as part of legitimate software.
- Some malware such as [[trojan horses]], viruses, and [[backdoors]] may require a host program to hide their attacks while others such as [[botnets]] and [[worms]] propagate independently.
