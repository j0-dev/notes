- **Operating Systems & File Systems**:

    - *Operating systems*:
        - Acts as interface between hardware and software/user
        - Manages CPU, memory, storage and devices

    - *Core components*:
        - Kernel: Core manager (handle memory, CPU time, file access)
        - User interface: CLI (`Command Line Interface`) or GUI (`Graphical User Interface`) for interacting with OS
        - Multitasking: Runs multiple processes, managed by the scheduler
        - Virtual memory: Uses disk space as extended RAM 
        - Device drivers: Translate OS instructions to specific hardware

    - *File Systems*:
        - Organises data into files and directories
        - Two layers: Logical FS (`File System`) (what the user sees) and Physical FS (how the data is stored on disk)
    - *File system types*:
        - FAT32 - Limited (4gb file max)
        - NTFS - modern, secure, supports encryption and permissions
        - exFAT - Lightweight, large files, good for external drives
        - APFS/Unix FS - Hierarhical, used in MacOS/Linux


- **Networks**:

    - *Network*: A collection of devices (nodes/hosts) sharing data between each other

    - *Media Types*:
        - Copper cables - cheap, short range
        - Fibre optic - Fast, expensive, long-range
        - Wireless - uses radio waves

    - *Topologies*:
        - Star: Central switch, common in LANs
        - Mesh: Redundancy and reliability
        - Point-to-point: WANs (`Wide Area Network`) like the internet

    - *Models*:
        - OSI (`Open Systems Interconnection`) (7-layer) vs TCP/IP (`Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol`) (4-layer)
        - Each layer handles a specific role in communication


- **Networking Devices and Operation**:

    - *Devices*:
        - Router: Connects networks, routes IP packets
        - Switch: Connects devices within a network using MAC (`Media Access Control`) addresses
        - NIC: Network Interface Card (physical interface)
        - WAP: Wireless Access Point (connects wireless clients)

    - *Routing*:
        - Uses routing tables and protocols:
            - RIP (`Routing Information Protocol`): Simple, based on hop count
            - OSPF (`Open Shortest Path First`): Advanced, considers latency, load, bandwidth

    - *Subnetting*:
        - Divides networks into sub-networks using subnet masks
        - ANDing used to calculate network addresses


- **Network Services and Network Security Concepts**:

    - *IPv4*: 32-bit, nearly exhausted
    - *IPv6*: 128-bit, huge space, removes need for NAT
    - *NAT* (`Network Address Translation`): Maps local IPs to public one.

    - *Key Protocols*:
        - DNS (`Domain Name System`): Converts URLs to IP Addresses
        - DHCP (`Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol`)

- **Cloud Computing**:

- **Emerging and Future Technologies**:

- **High Performance Computing**:
