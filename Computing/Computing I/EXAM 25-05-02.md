- **Operating Systems & File Systems**:

    - *Operating systems*:
        - Acts as interface between hardware and software/user
        - Manages CPU, memory, storage and devices

    - *Core components*:
        - Kernel: Core manager (handle memory, CPU time, file access)
        - User interface: CLI (`Command Line Interface`) or GUI (`Graphical User Interface`) for interacting with OS
        - Multitasking: Runs multiple processes, managed by the scheduler
        - Virtual memory: Uses disk space as extended RAM 
        - Device drivers: Translate OS instructions to specific hardware

    - *File Systems*:
        - Organises data into files and directories
        - Two layers: Logical FS (`File System`) (what the user sees) and Physical FS (how the data is stored on disk)
    - *File system types*:
        - FAT32 - Limited (4gb file max)
        - NTFS - modern, secure, supports encryption and permissions
        - exFAT - Lightweight, large files, good for external drives
        - APFS/Unix FS - Hierarhical, used in MacOS/Linux


- **Networks**:

    - *Network*: A collection of devices (nodes/hosts) sharing data between each other

    - *Media Types*:
        - Copper cables - cheap, short range

        - DNS (`Domain Name System`): Converts URLs to IP Addresses
        - DHCP (`Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol`)

    - *Cloud Computing*: "IT presented as a service to the user, delivered by virtualised resources that are independent of location"; a network of servers.

    - *Data Centre*:
        - Compute
        - Networks
        - Storage

    - *Virtualisation*:
        - Consolidates several independent OS on the same hardware
        - Hypverisor sits on top and is used to create VM's (`Virtual Machines`)
        - Virtualisation is the basis of cloud services

    - *Benefits of Cloud Computing*:
        - Cost savings - pay as you go
        - Evolvement of application - easy to change/update platform
        - Flexibility - Switch capability when needed
        - Scalability - React to changes easily
        - Redundancy - Duplicating critical hardware
        - Continuity - Backup and recovery 

    - *Datacentre vs Cloud Computing*:
        - Higher cost                   |   Pay for what you use
        - Less scalabale                |   See above
        - Need space for servers        |   No server space required
        - Less chance of data recovery  |   Disaster recovery
        - Lack of flexibility           |   High flexibility
        - Longer implementation time    |   Collaborate from widespread location
        -                               |   Rapid implementation

    - *Layered Model*:
        - Clients, Services, Application, Platform, Storage, Infrastructure

    - *Service Models*: 
        - Software as a Service (`SaaS`); MS Office, Dropbox
        - Platform as a Service (`PaaS`); A platform for apps; Azure, Google App Engine
        - Infrastructure as a Service (`IaaS`); Whole remote systems; AWS


- **Emerging and Future Technologies**:
    
    - *Emerging Technologies*: Technologies that are perceived as capable of changing the status quo.

    - *Quantum Computing*:
        - Makes use of quantum physics to compute
        - Exploit superposition: the idea a physical quantity can exist in more than one state at once, until it's observed.
        - The quantum bit, or qubit, is the basic storage unit
        - It is a number which can exist both as 0 and 1 at the same time. Until measured...


- **High Performance Computing**:

    - *HPC*: (`High Performance Computer`) a form of superocmputer with a high level of computation al capacity compared to a general purpose computer.

    - *Applications*:
        - Nuclear testing
        - Weather analysis
        - Space analysis
        - Extremely large data sets (e.g. 2021 census)
        - Quantum mechanical calculations
        - Biomolecular science

    - *Parallel Computing*:
        - HPC is usually about connecting multiple computer units and letting them share the same problem

    - *HPC Architecture*:
        - Shared memory architecture: Memory > Shared Bus > Processors
        - Distributed memory architecture: Multiple Processors > Interconnect
        - Hybrid Memory Architecture: Each unit works on it's own local problem; connected to share info
